\section{Introduction}

Train a ML classifier to classify receipt texts to COICOP labels:
- Several levels of COICOP
- Receipt text for Plus and LIDL supermarkets
- Encode receipt text as a vector, several methods: 
    - Several encodings have different qualities, evaluate quality of these encodings
    - Which encoding/embedding works the best?
    - Do we need to train our own embedding?
    - How do vector distances differ between COICOP categories?
    
Can we find new products easily? Outlier/Novelty detection methods:    
    - Cluster on vectors of receipt text

- Train on one supermarket, evaluate on other supermarket
- Which product categories are most difficult to classify?
- Which product caterogies are classified best/worst?
- How do supermarkets differ in their product categories?

String distances:
- How do string distances differ between COICOP categories?

From previous work it became clear that ML classifier performance degrades over time
- Evaluate degradation of performance over time:
    - Train on one year, evaluate on next year
