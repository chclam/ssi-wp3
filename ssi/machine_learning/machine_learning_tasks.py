# TODO add an evaluation that trains a model on one supermarket and evaluates it on another.
# Check TFIDF and CountVectorizer for the feature extraction; they use a word dictionary,
# this dictionary may be supermarket specific! i.e. features from one supermarket may not be usable with another.
# TODO Return feature extraction pipeline instead?
